TAG Collective
Developer Intern (Fall/Winter 2022)

I would love to be able to make a strong contribution to the products and stories that your team creates. I’m very self motivated and will do my best to integrate with your systems to be effective in using web and app development to turn your content and stories into streamlined and enjoyable user experiences. I’m extremely interested in your agency’s work and your unique Storyscaling strategy, as my experiences with my own business and youtube channels have made me realize both the importance and also the difficulty of marketing and brand building. Some highlights of what can make me valuable to your team includes:
Hands-on experience with turning complex ideas into easily digestible and engaging forms - My experiences successfully running youtube channels in the past and marketing the products for my most recent project has given me practice with selecting and focusing on the most important aspects of a product/idea I am trying to sell, and communicating that to an audience in a way that is very engaging.
I am a very driven self-starter who is eager to learn new skills and apply them in business-minded ways - Managing a variety of projects has given me varied practical experience in different aspects of managing a large project: From starting a profitable business where I design, prototype, manufacture, market, and sell custom mechanical keyboard cases, to my youtube channel where I did lots of market research, targeted specific audiences using seo, advertisement in niche forums, and community building, and created programming tutorials with a fine-tuned balance of educational merit and entertainment value
I have had lots of experience turning fun learning experiences into successful (and profitable) ventures. I believe that these experiences, and the skills that I learned through them, would make me a very valuable asset to your team.

Fluor
IT Technician I

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Information Technology (IT) Technician position at Fluor. As a highly motivated individual deeply interested in technology, I am confident that my skills and experiences align with the requirements of this position. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained valuable experience in supporting and maintaining computer systems, diagnosing and troubleshooting hardware issues, and providing end-user assistance.

In my experience as both a body tracking intern at my bionics lab, and as the software lead for my team in Rocket Project UCLA, I had lots of experience with implementing programs with new software and hardware into systems I had never seen before, and demonstrated by ability to troubleshoot complex systems. The multitude of obstacles in these positions gave me lots of hands-on experience in diagnosing and resolving software and hardware-related issues, as well as collaborating and communicating the solutions to others.

In addition to my technical expertise, I possess strong documentation skills, having written detailed records on complicated software system architecture and workflows we use in both my X1 robotics club at UCLA and Rocket Project. I excel at creating organized and comprehensive documentation to ensure clarity and accessibility.

Being deeply immersed in technology for essentially all of my life, I have honed my ability to solve tech-related problems over many years, and I know that I would be able to make a strong contribution in this IT technician role. 

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the success of Fluor
