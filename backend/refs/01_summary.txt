Overview: Shell hosted the Capital Markets Day (CMD) at the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.  The new CEO, Wael Sawan outlined a strategy focused on ‘performance, discipline and simplification’. The company maintained liquid production volume target of ~1.4 mbpd through 2030, but eliminated prior CCS and hydrogen volume targets and electricity sales targets.  Shell also announced capex cuts of $2B and opex cuts of $2-$3B. Management reiterated that the powering progress strategy remains the same and laid out a mid-term plan to improve performance, while maintaining capital discipline. CEO spoke about a ‘fundamental culture’ shift which will be needed to boost investor confidence. Please note, five years ago, Shell had a market cap of $40B less than that of Exxon Mobil. Today, the difference (in market cap) is more than $200B.  Please see attached slides and a preliminary transcript which was released today.

Highlights:
Financial discipline and capex reduction
Growing the integrated gas and upstream business
Strategic review of downstream, renewables & energy solutions

Financial discipline and capex reduction

• Capex guidance for 2024-25 was reduced from $23-$27B per year to $22-$25B per year. Capex for 2023 remains at $23-$27B and includes acquisition of Nature Energy, a biogas producer for $2B. Capex beyond 2025 was not provided.
• Opex cuts of $2-3B by 2025 which include divestments or exit from low-return businesses and more streamlined work processes.
• Cash flow from operations or CFFO target increased from 20-30% to 30-40%.
• Dividend per share increased 15% in Q2 2023 and 2H 2023 buybacks of at least $5B.

Growing the integrated gas and upstream business:

• Shell announced plans to invest $13B per year from 2023-25 in the Integrated Gas and LNG business, including $2B per year to increase the supply of natural gas to LNG facilities. Management reiterated ‘value over volume’ strategy, underpinned by strong cash flow generation.
• LNG – Shell plans to add 11 Mtpa of LNG capacity by 2030, including the North Field South project in Qatar. Shell LNG Canada was highlighted as 80% complete with start-up expected by mid-decade. Management did not provide any additional details.
• Upstream - Maintained liquids production at ~1.4 mbpd till end of 2030. Shell had previously announced a 1-2% annual production decline into 2030.  At the CMD, management stated that it had achieved that target earlier than expected through divestments (sale of Permian assets) and lower onshore production (such as Nigeria). Shell also announced new exploration wells in Namibia.
• Offshore – Announced plans to add volumes in the Gulf of Mexico and add 3 additional FPSOs in the Santos Basin, Brazil.
• Relative to 2014, the upstream business has the ability to generate 80% more cash with 20% less production.

Strategic review of downstream and renewables & energy solutions:

• Plans to invest $35B from 2023-25 into downstream and renewable & energy solutions of which $10-$15B will be on low-carbon energy solutions.
• Downstream - Plans to repurpose its Energy and Chemicals Parks footprint to offer more low-carbon solutions to its customers. Since 2020, Shell has divested 5 refineries, closed 1 and converted 1 into a terminal.
• Initiate a strategic review of its Energy and Chemicals Park assets on Bukom and Jurong Island in Singapore, and high-grade its European footprint.
• Management hinted that underperforming businesses such as power generation, marketing and chemicals will need to improve or risk being sold.
• Energy transition – Shell eliminated CCS and hydrogen volumetric targets, but will continue to invest in hydrogen, CCS and power long term. Shell expects IIR of >12% from the low carbon business. CEO confirmed that Shell had dropped its previous target of doubling electricity sales by 2030.
• Performance of the marketing business has been below expectations in 2023. Shell will reduce capex by 50% from $6B to $3B. The company will also divest from Shell Pakistan Limited, which has a large retail and lubricants business.
• Shell will continue to invest in EV charging infrastructure. Management indicated that within its top 20 markets, 90% of the population lives within 15 to 20 minutes of a Shell mobility site.
• Management reiterated plans to achieve 50% reduction in emissions intensity by 2030 (from 2016 levels) and to be a net zero company by 2050.

Additional information shared:

• Digital solutions and cloud computing have doubled the speed of seismic data processing. AI has helped increase LNG production at Shell by 1% to 2%.
