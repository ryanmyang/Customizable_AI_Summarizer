BEGIN TRANSCRIPT

big hand please for trevor

hello

uh thank you guys all so much for coming

here this is a fantastic honor to be uh

to be here with you all um but let's

let's get right into it we don't have as

much time as i would like to have but

it's always like that

i've been spending a lot of time in

helicopters lately

i'm an artist but i'm not somebody who

goes into a studio every day with some

paint and makes a mess and comes out the

at the end of the day with a painting or

anything like that i have a very

empirical practice

meaning i go out into the world do

things and they spend a lot of time

running around looking at stuff

and one of the overarching themes of my

projects has to do with trying to push

vision

and trying to push perception

as as far as i can

um usually to the point where it starts

to break down and the reason for that is

that i hope that by investigating some

of these limit cases of vision these

limit cases of perception that we can

kind of create a vantage point that we

can then use to look back on ourselves

with different kinds of eyes with fresh

eyes if you will and for me that's

really what i want out of art a lot of

people want a lot of different things

out of art some people want beauty some

people want something nice that hangs on

their sofa or whatever what i want out

of art is things that help us see the

historical moment that we're living in

so that's what i want

and so for me that's that's what this is

sort of about today i want to talk about

secrecy

and i want to talk about how to go about

trying to see

secrecy and this is something that i've

spent a lot of time thinking about over

the years

a lot of times people think about

secrecy as

what you get to know versus what you

don't get to know so secrecy is stuff

that we don't get to know and stuff

that's not secret is stuff that we do

get to know

and i think that that way of thinking

about secrecy is wrong

right i think in the first instance

secrecy is more about a way of doing

things it's a way of trying to organize

human activities and it has political

aspects to it it has economic aspects to

it it has legal aspects to it has

cultural aspects to it

and it's a way of trying to do things um

whose goal

is invisibility

silence obscurity

and so in this first instance of what

secrecy is i would think about it as

what we might call an abstract space a

kind of organizing logic and they call

it an abstract space because it doesn't

actually exist right it's a it's a it's

a it's a conceptual

thing it's a way of trying to organize

things it's in in that first instance

secrecy is very immaterial

however in the real world

secrecy only exists in so far as its

logic is applied to things in the world

in other words the material stuff that

everything in the world is made of so in

real life secrecy is composed of

infrastructures and institutions things

like the cia or the nsa um economic

institutions like the the so-called

black budget in the united states it

also is composed of social engineering

institutions such as the uh

security classification system

legal institutions such as the fisa

court and the state secrets president of

the united states and so on and so on

so

all of that is a way of trying to

underline the fact that i don't think

about secrecy as what you get to know

versus what you don't get to know i

think about it instead as a kind of

state within a state a state that

operates according to a very very

different logic than what we would

normally think of as a democratic state

and also as a series of material

practices things that happen in the

world

so

the question then is

if secrecy is a way of organizing

institutions and

human activities in such a way as to try

to render them silent to render them

invisible how do we go about trying to

see them

right

and sometimes when i talk about how do

we go about trying to see secrecy i use

this metaphor from cosmology the

metaphor of dark matter where we know

that 97 percent of the universe is made

out of dark matter and dark energy it's

stuff that we can't see we can't

directly detect but we can infer its

existence by the influence that it

exerts on the visible universe right so

it's something that we can only

indirectly detect

and

so in other words by seeing that

interaction of this invisible matter

with the invisible matter we can learn

something about it and i think perhaps

something is true of secrecy as well

because i think that secrecy is an

inherently uh contradictory thing it's a

self-contradictory thing

and the reason for that is that this

organizing logic of secrecy as it has to

uh take hold as is articulated in the

material world it's never completely

efficient

and i'm in in the first instance the

idea of secrecy is not efficient uh

because in if it's true that secrecy has

to be made out of the same stuff that

the rest of the world is made out of

stuff in the world

tends to reflect light right it's

visible kind of fundamentally and so we

have this kind of original contradiction

in the idea of secrecy so for example if

you're going to build a secret airplane

you can't build it in an invisible

factory with ghost workers you have to

build it in a factory that looks like

any kind of other factory you have to

build it with people that you know do

same kind of things that any other

person does so secrecy is not efficient

it has this original contradiction and i

think that that original contradiction

gives rise to all sorts of other kinds

of contradictions and so

methodologically

what i'm trying to do often is find

those contradictions where does that

secret world intersect with something i

can see where is it intersect with

something that i uh can find

and

using that methodology trying to get a

glimpse

into the aspects of secrecy in the

secret state that surrounds us all of

the time

but that we really generally have not

trained ourselves to see very well

so i want to talk about a series of

these kinds of contradictions

contradiction that has been enormously

helpful to me has to do with logistics

logistics is uh logistics if you are

going to you know as the united states

does if you're going to operate you know

secret wars all over the world and

you're going to have you know military

bases in you know nearly 200 countries

and spying posts and spy satellites and

this sort of thing you need to have

logistical infrastructures uh to support

that to you know vary people around move

things around that sort of thing

um a crucial part of any logistical

infrastructure tends to involve

airplanes

um just because you have to fly people

around documents around and so on and so

forth and so a number of years ago

this is something that i picked on

up quite a lot i was very interested in

the cia's

extraordinary rendition program this is

their kidnapping and torture program

that they're running all over the world

and one of the uh theories that um that

i this is a guy who i always spend some

time working with on this stuff um

one of the ideas that i was working with

an investigative journalist and there's

about a dozen people around the world

from human rights groups other

journalists who are trying to figure

this stuff out and one of the ideas was

that if you could

track the movements of airplanes that

were known to be involved in this

program then you could perhaps get a an

understanding of what the geography of

this covert action looked like right we

knew people were disappearing

uh from all over the world we didn't

know where they were going uh the the

cia or the military would come out and

say something like oh well we we caught

abu zubaydah for example

and then this guy wouldn't show up at

guantanamo bay

and so if you thought about it you

thought well this guy has to be in the

world somewhere and because this guy has

to be in the world somewhere there's got

to be some secret prisons out there so

that's what thing we were interested in

now

the other kind of classic the classic

way that you organize logistics if

you're the central intelligence agency

or uh certain parts of the military is

that you create front companies you

create fake companies um to do your

logistics for you and this is a very

very good idea for several reasons

um first of all it's a good idea because

it keeps your name off of things all

right so you don't you can create a fake

company it's doing stuff around the

world it doesn't ever say cia or nsa or

whatever it is anywhere in the paperwork

that you have to file so it's a very

very good idea in that sense it's a very

good idea in a second sense as well

which is that there is much more freedom

of movement afforded to a civilians than

there is to the world's military so for

example if you want to charter airplane

tomorrow and fly to karachi pakistan

that's absolutely no problem you have to

pay overflight fees and some landing

fees but it's no big deal

if you're the military tomorrow and you

fly a bunch of planes into karachi you

just started a war so

creating fake companies is a great idea

for freedom of movement as well

the problem is

with creating fake companies is that you

have to file all the same kinds of

paperwork that any other company in the

world has to file and the aviation

industry is a highly regulated industry

you generate an enormous paper trail

and so the theory was

if we can identify what

airplane companies we think are involved

in this program

we might be able to

track them somehow and learn something

about the geography of this program

so we're thinking about what are all the

things that i would want to be able to

do if i was a front company working for

the cia flying all over the world and

one of the things that we thought of was

well what i'd want to be able to do is

land at military air bases anywhere i

wanted in the world i want to be able to

refuel at military air bases and so we

had the idea of writing to the military

and asking hey can you give us a list of

all the civilian

companies who have clearances to land at

military airfields and what clearances

that they uh

what airfields have clearances to land

at so you get this document right here

there's an older version of something

called the calp

and um it basically is a list of

companies who are allowed to land at

military airfields and which ones they

can do that at so on this list you'll

find things like alaska airlines

you know ups

uh dhl you know mostly companies that do

logistics also for the military

but when you start to get in the guts of

the and the vast majority of these only

have clearances to land in conus that

means continental united states

but when you get further into this

document some weird things emerge you

start to find companies like this

stevens express leasing who has a

worldwide clearance they can land at any

military airfield they want

richmore aviation we're going to come

back to these guys

rapid air trans all of these have

worldwide clearances these very strange

companies path corporation premier

executive transport services

anyway there's so there's varying

degrees of what goes on with these

companies richmond aviation has you know

some actual places i got real interested

in this company though here premier

executive transport services who have

pulled the paperwork from the the faa

on file and turns out they have an

address premier executive transport

services 339 washington street suite 202

dedham massachusetts

uh in this building right here they're

located on the second floor the sign

outside says hill and placias attorneys

these are a couple of divorce lawyers

outside of boston

so when i went in there and asked them

to talk to somebody about premier

executive transport services they threw

me out um

i uh but i did you know just kept

looking poking at this company you know

a company it's a public company has to

file all kinds of uh you know articles

of incorporation you know updates tax

filings that sort of thing i got real

interested in people who were on the

boards and the um the uh the staff of

these companies started collecting their

signatures finding people like colleen

bourne

brian dice

james kershaw

tyler edward tate this is my all-time

favorite

if you haven't figured this out yet

tyler edward tate's not a real person uh

tyler edward

tate has a birthday in the 1950s but a

social security number issued in the

1990s has no credit rating uh never got

a loan from a bank never got a driver's

license never got married doesn't really

have any of the electronic trail that

each of us generate really every few

seconds in our lives

tyler edward tate's only address was

this a p.o box at this post office

outside the airport in washington dc

box 221

943

so i did a reverse record search on the

po box and hundreds of names

show up

um

and and these are all these are ghosts

right these are all of these names are

people who don't exist and they don't

exist because they're in the business of

disappearing other people

um but going back to the airplane

companies what you could do because

these are civilian airplane companies

you had a list of companies that you're

interested in you go back to the faa and

say i want to see all the registration

numbers and serial numbers for all of

the airplanes that are owned by this set

of companies so you get back the list of

airplanes registration number serial

numbers you go back to the faa and you

say i would like to see all the flight

plans that these particular airplanes

have ever filed with you start to get

documents that look like this

you get the registration number uh of a

of an airplane landed iad that means

washington dulles

uh this one

right here bgr is bangor maine okay

f.a.y is the home of the special forces

community in fayetteville north carolina

e i n n shannon ireland mugm guantanamo

bay

so we started tracking different

routes where all these things were

flying the idea being if you could see

multiple flights to a single location

perhaps that was a place to

pay some more attention to i'm going to

fly through this i've talked about this

quite a lot and there's documentation of

these projects online we had other

sources of of information as well this

is a map drawn by a former ghost

prisoner a guy named khalid al-masri of

what he believed the inside of one of

these

black or dark prisons looked like

using this combination of information

tracking flight plans and that sort of

thing were able to figure out

uh the very probable location of a cia

black site north um east of kabul

and so uh in this this building so we

flew out there

and um had to spend quite a bit of time

finding a taxi driver who knew

where this road was this road had been

so dangerous for so long that um you

wouldn't people from before you we had

to find someone who'd been driving a cab

since before the soviet occupation of

afghanistan so uh all of our translate

our arts fixtures we need to find the

old man you know someone who knows where

this road that you're talking about is

um so we'd start driving out there and

you leave the the city behind you

and uh you know you're kind of out in

the sticks in afghanistan and we end up

in a traffic jam but it's not a bunch of

cars it's a herd of goats going across

the street waiting for these goats to go

by and we see the shepherd very old man

you know the traditional afghan clothes

and the whole thing big beard exactly

what you'd picture in your head but we

noticed hey this guy this shepherd he's

wearing a baseball hat

that's weird um it's waiting for him to

go by the shepherd finally turns to look

at us in the car wearing a black

baseball hat the letters kbr are on that

baseball hat kbr stands for something

called kellogg brown and root which is a

company that was a subsidiary of another

company called halliburton which of

course was the company that dick cheney

was uh the the on the board of and so

here we are in the middle of nowhere

afghanistan next to what we are

99.99 positive is a secret cia prison

the local goat herder is wearing a dick

cheney baseball hat

this is another black site also in kabul

now when you're i'm but i'm really

interested in this front companies and

because what i'm interested in is i want

to understand what does the domestic

architecture of a covert operation like

this look like what does it look like at

home what does it look like you know

just what it would we all imagine covert

operations being secret prisons and

gruesome scenes of torture and that sort

of thing and that's all true but i

wanted to understand what also

facilitates that what is the other kinds

of architecture that enable that and we

got a huge glimpse into that a couple of

years ago when two of these front

companies so these front companies are

they're they're sort of in this gray

zone sometimes where they do real work

and they're real businesses and they

have you know you know cash flows and

things like that

but they're also primarily doing work

for the cia so what happened was two of

these front companies got in a billing

dispute

over invoices unpaid invoices for

rendition flights and one of the

companies was this company here richmore

aviation the other company is a company

called sports flight airways and this is

a company that does uh organizes charter

airplanes for

sports teams and the cia

i'm not making this up um so

anyway this lawsuit because both of the

companies were located in new york the

lawsuit ended up going down in the

district court in a small court in new

york and nobody noticed that this thing

had happened for like three years

including the cia who didn't bother

nobody you know noticed that this

lawsuit was happening so nobody invoked

the state secrets privilege nobody got

it thrown out of court so this crazy

thing that happened

um so there ended up being depositions

and you know uh evidentiary findings and

that sort of thing just thousands of

documents were generated and um these uh

people at the human rights group

reprieve in the uk got their hands on

this stuff and i got it from them and in

these documents you find invoices for

rendition flights this is a fight

washington guantanamo bay bucharest

rabat you know

without the bill is 165 000 or something

uh you know euro control uh documents

invoices for telephone calls that were

made during the in-flight telephone

calls that these guys were making back

home to um to headquarters or whatever

it was these guys are trying to

reimburse for these satellite phone

bills

depositions

and so i spent you know a long time with

all this stuff and just started making

this giant map just trying to understand

what all of the different relationships

were that were being outlined in these

in these documents um turns out dying

core was one of the big people behind it

but then even at dine court found out

the names of different managers for

parts of the program that sort of thing

you know sports flight was at the center

of it and the uh sports site was also

charting with this other whole other

bunch of companies also doing rendition

flights as well that we didn't know

about

um and i just started going around and

photographing these places i wanted to

understand i wanted to see the places

that were talking about in these

documents this here's sports flight in

long island they kind of had a failed

attempt to try to tape over the name of

their sign

um in the depositions you have stuff

like this who you know who ron dickey is

he's the backup program manager for

supporting bill vigil i wanted to know

what bill vigil looked like so i sat

outside his house

here's a ron dickey

yeah it was the the one they're talking

about another company called uh the uh

with international group or something in

horse heads new york u.s aviation blah

blah blah prime jet in california just

wanted to see

where these places were

the only area i knew was larry seals i

never met him do you know if he's

employed by anybody as far as you know

the state department i want to know what

he looked like

what this all adds up to is what i think

of as a very everyday landscape

so we're looking at an incredibly secret

incredibly in my opinion evil

covert operation and what does it look

like it doesn't look like anything it

looks like the rest of the world that's

around us all of the time and for me

there's something actually quite

terrifying about that

other contradictions

places to find covert activities have

places to see secrecy well you don't

have to go far at all you can step

outside and look up in the sky and then

there's many ways that i that i do that

i've spent a lot of time out in nevada

all of the drones uh pretty much in the

world are flown by pilots based in

nevada north um

northwest of las vegas you drive about

an hour out into the desert and there's

a little air force base out in the

desert called creech air force base you

kind of even have to know that it's

there

and what you do is you go out there you

park your car

you just look up at the sky

you look up at the sky and it takes a

minute or so for your eyes to adjust and

then you realize

there's all these little things that

look like insects flying around and what

it is is you're seeing drones

and and so i've spent a lot of time out

there just photographing the sky it's

generally early in the morning so you

have these big skyscapes and when you

look a little bit closer you find these

little you know guys in there that don't

belong

a few months ago i saw something very

remarkable out there

this is something i'm not sure anybody's

ever seen one of these and uh you know

just flying around before this i'm

pretty sure this is one of these uh rq

uh 170 sentinel drones

and it's the weirdest sound it sounds

like a tie fighter or something like

that one's flying by

um this of course was the drone that the

iranians managed to bring down a couple

years ago

and uh yes it did these kind of

skyscapes i'm really um

but when i'm looking at this stuff i'm

not just looking to see like there's a

drone i'm trying to understand what does

it kind of look like historically and

i'm thinking about what kind of images

do these kinds of things perhaps rhyme

with throughout the history of images i

spend way too much time thinking about

turner and this is eternal turner's

painting an angel in the sun from the

mid 19th century i was trying to think

about well what does that look like now

perhaps it looks like the reaper in the

sun and of course you can't see the

reaper in here because it's like really

that big on a giant print

um i also spent a lot of time looking at

the night sky and particularly what i'm

looking for and what i'm doing is as

tracking satellites and tracking

classified satellites tracking objects

in the sky that you know aren't there as

it were for for political reasons you

know for all the secret things in the

sky and it turns out you know we're on

this theme of contradictions right

that you hate that stuff secret stuff is

made out of the same stuff that that

everything else in the world is made out

of and the same is true of some of the

most you know classified machines in the

world which are above our heads in the

night sky they all have to obey kepler's

laws of planetary motion so if you put

something

in

in orbit around the earth

and you can get a couple of good

observations of it you can very very

accurately model its orbit and you can

predict where it will be to a high

degree of accuracy and there's a group

of amateur astronomers around the world

about a dozen guys who are really good

at this um who this is what they do

every night they go out with binoculars

and telescopes and that sort of thing

and measure the locations of

reconnaissance spacecraft and so you get

numbers like this this is called a tle

or a two line element it's a series of

numbers that describe the orbit of a

spacecraft and you can go and you know

there's various software applications

where you can kind of plug your tle file

into a basically a sky chart and you can

predict where something will be in the

sky

once you predict where it will be in the

sky you can go out and try to photograph

these things now this is a lot easier

said than done

um you're trying to point you know

photograph a little tiny point of light

this is a photograph of a system that

thanks to ed snowden we know is called a

keyhole enhanced crystal system this is

basically like an evil twin of the

hubble space telescope that's pointed

down at earth and there's a whole bunch

of these things um and what you're

seeing here that line in the middle of

the image is the spacecraft moving

through the the frame over the course of

a long exposure the reason this is so

orange is that you're seeing this is

shot from the city so you're seeing the

street lights and noise pollution

bouncing off low clouds

do you see strange things in the sky

this is an image of a spacecraft called

pan that was launched a few years ago

p-a-n and it was launched into a

geostationary orbit it's an orbit that

looks like this very very far away so it

basically orbits around the earth at the

same rate that the earth itself is

rotating

and pan was very very strange for a

couple of reasons um

it right here it's this

little dot

obviously

and

i had to actually fly to south africa to

take this picture um because pan's over

the indian ocean um but pan so normally

there's all kinds of spy satellites and

classified launches that are happening

in in in every single case a classified

launch will either have a military

launch number or what's called a

national reconnaissance office launch

number so the military will always

announce when they're launching some

when they're going to launch a rocket

because they don't want to think the

russians that they're they're starting

you know the next world war something

like that so i say we're launching a

rocket here's the uh the nrol number uh

it's going to be around this day and

around this time this thing called pan

p-a-n shows up on the launch manifest

and does not it shows up as a classified

payload but does not have an nro launch

number and does not have a military

launch number so what the hell is this

thing

um there's a patch for it says pan

palladium at night

um but word on the street was that pan

pandas

stood for pick a name

um

the patch has this rocket going off you

see very faintly in the smoke below the

rocket you see this question mark

so pan goes up it turns out later

there's a little lockheed brochure that

mentioned in passing that that pan was

based on i believe a lockheed a 2800 bus

so uni so it's basically a kind of

communication satellite goes into this

geostationary orbit

over the indian ocean and just sits

there and so what the hell is this thing

well if it's not got an nrol or a

military launch number then presumably

it's another government agency that

would have this communication satellite

over the indian ocean

so

at this point i'm just making up

conspiracy theories the first idea that

i had with some other people was that

okay who would want to have a whole lot

of bandwidth over the indian ocean who's

not the nro who's not nsa who's not the

military we started to think okay maybe

cia it's the only other agency that i

could think of and cia doesn't put their

name on anything so we thought okay why

would the cia want to have like a whole

lot of bandwidth over the indian ocean

the first thing you might think of is

maybe they want to talk to their guys

around the world but that's way overkill

to have a dedicated communication

satellite to do that so the second

thought was thinking about

well actually let's think about what's

going on here because there's two drone

wars there's the military one that

places it you know in kind of active

battlefields like um uh iraq and

afghanistan and so on but all of the the

drones uh assassinations that are going

on in places like pakistan uh yemen and

so forth are run by cia and see i would

definitely want to have a lot of

bandwidth to um to fly those things uh

the bandwidth on this spacecraft could i

think do 40 simultaneous drone missions

something like that so that was one

theory but that theory got a little bit

more complicated because what pan

started doing was moving around the

geostationary belt and parking itself

within clusters of other communication

satellites which is highly highly

unusual behavior because this burns up a

lot of fuel and it dramatically reduces

the usable lifetime of your spacecraft

so what is pan i don't know nobody knows

i mean who knows what the hell this

thing is

one of those things

this is another weird little thing that

went up in 2009 on the delta iv heavy

rocket in in january 2009 a gigantic nsa

uh spacecraft went up again over the

middle east and a friend of mine in

south africa an astronomer said hey

trevor you should go take a look at usa

202 which was the name that were that

was kind of publicly used for the thing

that okay

um so i was out in the eastern

hemisphere a place where i could see

this thing and i took this photograph

and and usa 202

is

this thing right here this really really

bright light this is apparently one of

the biggest uh you know heaviest most

expensive spacecraft that the nsa and

nro have ever made supposedly it has a

giant antenna about the size of a

football field you know a big umbrella

shaped antenna

and i wrote back to my friend and said

yeah i saw you know here's got this

picture of it he's like no you're not

you're not even paying attention to what

you're looking at are you and i was like

what are you talking about he was like

well did you notice what it's next to

and i hadn't thought about that even

though it's right there in the picture

he said we'll go look that up and it

turns out this little line here is an

unclassified spacecraft it's a

spacecraft called thoria 2. what the

raya 2 does is all the satellite

telecommunications for the middle east

so it's

just right there

see it through a telescope

anyway there's other kinds of images

like this too i have some fun with this

every photographer has to have their

version of yosemite so my version of

yosemite is photographing yosemite and

you know we've got a a you know one of

these enhanced crystal spacecraft in the

sky photographing me photographing

yosemite

um

yeah as we know from looking at all the

snowden documents but we knew this

already that secret societies are

obsessed with symbols this has always

been the case going back to old roman

mystery religions where they had these

elaborate symbolic languages that were

sort of kind of elliptically kind of

trying to describe the the secrets that

these secret societies held well the

same turns out to be true for uh parts

of the military in the intelligence

community as well and you often find

that in the form of patches that people

wear on their uniforms and it turns out

that there's all these black projects in

the military and intelligence community

and they make uniform patches for them

and it's the damnedest thing i mean i've

asked a number of these guys why the

hell are you making uniform patches for

black projects and they said oh well if

we just if we didn't have apache now

that would really look weird right okay

so you find stuff like this

the the special projects flight test

squadron this is a unit they're based at

area 51 in nevada this famous secret

base

and all they do is fly secret airplanes

and their patch it has all these symbols

it all means stuff so here's this radar

you have a generic airframe you have

this sword here that sword actually

refers to a classified airframe that's

now been declassified called bird of

prey there uh this thing falling from

the sky is a radar calibration target so

it's an aluminum ball with a known radar

cross section that you throw out the

back of an airplane you use it to tune a

radar

their mascot is this wizard with a staff

the lightning bolt in the kind of visual

language of this stuff usually

represents electronic warfare

um he's holding this sigma symbol which

rep when you do the uh when you're doing

the um engineering equations to design

stealth aircraft this is uh like the

unknown kind of ideal radar cross

section this is like the goal of

invisibility

and then right here you have a

collection of five stars and one off to

the side five one these guys work at the

famous area 51 secret base now

based on our you know like looking at

these kind of questions of logistics you

realize that you know there's a huge

amount of infrastructure that has to go

into something like the special projects

flight test squadron if you want to have

secret airplanes and secret test pilots

in a secret air base then you need to

have things like secret air traffic

controllers you need to have things like

secret maintenance crews

down to the point where you need to have

secret cafeteria people and secret

janitor people and secret doctors you

know flight surgeons and so on and

secret data entry people and so on so

and so on the whole thing if you're

gonna fly secret airplanes uh you need

to refuel them right and typically in

the air force the way that you refuel a

plane is with what's called a tanker

squadron you have a flying tanker and

your airplane comes up and gets the gas

off the tank or flies away so if you're

going to fly secret airplanes you need a

secret tanker squadron

now this uh there the secret tank where

squadron's mascot is this phantom guy

the thing he's holding in his hand is a

tanker boom so it's like the the boom

that you lower down into uh an airplane

to refuel it um and then here at the

bottom we have this it says n k a w t g

dot dot dot nobody now n k a w t g is

something it turns out you find on all

the patches for all the tanker squadrons

in the entire air force

it stands for no one kicks ass without

tanker gas

you quickly start to build a whole world

when you're building secret airplanes

this blew my mind when i found out about

this somebody sent me this crap so it

turns out you have all these secret

units the special projects guys and the

secret flight tanker squadron guys

they all have football teams for their

squadrons and they all play against the

other secret squadrons in the secret

football league

so i got my hands on this good thing

right here and this is a the the ring

for the the football team for the red

hats right the red hats is another

secret unit also flying out of area 51

you got your five stars in one and their

motto is more with less and their mascot

is a bear climbing over the world

wearing a red hat

if you can guess what these guys do

you're really good but i'll tell you

what they do is they fly a small

squadron of stolen uh soviet and russian

migs all right

and their motto is more with less

because they only have a few of these

migs that they fly now i knew all these

symbols i knew a lot about the red hats

i've talked to guys who've been in that

squadron the guy who sent me this class

ring i wrote back to him i said i know

all these symbols mean but there's

something i don't understand right here

b-h-a-s i've never seen that before can

you tell me what that is and he said oh

yeah i'll tell you

blue hats ain't

rapid capabilities office they got their

little black world in in the background

of their patch

um

these guys are these guys are in charge

of i don't know if you heard about this

the x-37b space plane uh so this is the

air force has their own little

drone version of a space shuttle that's

secret um that's flying around right now

it's a kind of a reusable vehicle i

think it's on its third mission right

now that's been lasting forever here's a

photograph of it in the sky

um the uh the flight crews for the x-37b

this uh their secret drone space shuttle

this is their patch

and they're all organized by they're all

working under this rapid capabilities

office uh the rapid capabilities down uh

office down here this their little

slogan is uh doing god's work with other

people's money

you know there's a lot a lot of times

you can learn operational details about

programs based on these patches i

mentioned that before this thing this is

an older patch for the there for an old

uh constellation of spacecraft called

onyx it turns out the orbital

inclinations on this patch are accurate

so you um so you could find out what the

you know where this constellation of

secret spacecraft was and you can find

out what they do this the patch says we

own the night and it has this picture of

owl eyes or cat eyes so this theme of

seeing at night this is an imaging orbit

so you'll only be in this orbit if

you're taking pictures how are you going

to take pictures at night well you do it

with something called a synthetic

aperture radar and uh

yeah so uh here's a picture of that

thing um i published this stuff for the

nro there was a memo

saying hey guys stop putting operational

details of the classified spacecraft

into the patches guys are on to us

so um the nro started having to make

patches that look like this

this is uh for this launched a couple

weeks ago this is for the second

generation of the synthetic rapture in

mr imaging spacecraft this one's called

topaz

um this is an old favorite uh let them

hate so long as they fear

and this one kind of sums up the whole

thing

this is for one of these

spy satellites that suck up you know one

of these nsa things

uh the classic in the genre

don't ask none of your business

and so i want to come back to this

original contradiction to start begin

wrapping up here a little bit the idea

that you know when you you're making

you're doing all this secret stuff it it

fits imperfectly into the world you

can't make invisible factories you can't

you know you have to have

infrastructures that go into these

covert operations infrastructures

generate paperwork they generate you

know

invoices and crap like that but they

also have a material footprint on this

earth surface a lot of places

that are you know associated with

classified activities of course are all

over the world but there's a lot in the

west in particular they're way out in

the desert you can't get anywhere near

these things

many times they'll have buffer zones of

30 40 50 60 miles around them so there's

literally no place that you can stand on

public land and see them with your eyes

in many cases so what i started doing

was uh you know

quite

literally using tools designed for

astronomy and astrophotography and

trying to

use them for terrestrial photography

asking

myself if what if i buy a telescope

that's designed to take a picture of the

planet jupiter

and try to take a picture of a military

base you know 40 miles away or so what

happens it'd be like if in a traditional

landscape photograph like an ansel adams

is probably using something like a 50

millimeter lens what happens if you use

a 5 000 millimeter lens instead

well you start to see a little bit

different a little bit of a different

landscape

and these are what some of these images

look like this is you know the area 51

that's come up a couple of times here

um

this is the uh the massive the big data

center that the nsa is finishing up in

utah that keeps blowing up but um this

is what this thing is

this is a site in west virginia

called the

the code name of it is timberline this

is another one of these nsa

eavesdropping stations this is uh where

most recently they were involved in some

of the spying on unicef and the un world

health program was going on from here

this is the aerospace data facility uh

southwest this is a down link for

reconnaissance satellites in new mexico

uh classify a classified airbase for

operational uh aircraft also in

uh nevada this is taken from about 18 20

miles away

when you start photographing things at

these kind of extreme distances you're

looking through so much heat and so much

haze that the images you know start to

break down quite literally and so in an

image like this which is taken from

about 40 miles away these are chemical

and biological weapons proving grounds

in utah

you start to veer towards

total abstraction and so in an image

like this you're seeing two things it's

an image of a classified military base

but it's also a photograph of what it

looks like when you've pushed the

physical properties of vision so far

that they just fall apart

at 60 miles you start to get stuff like

this

which

looks like stuff like this

um

so just kind of conclude a a a

a couple of thoughts

the world is is is constantly changing

and and i feel like our job or my job as

an artist is try to see how it's

constantly

changing and one of the things i've been

thinking a lot about are images like

this earlier today travis godspeed

mentioned in passing that there was a

you know a couple of years ago there was

groups of guys who were pulling uh video

uh links uh from drone flights around

the world off of uh on open satellite

channels off just a regular

communication satellite so i got my

hands on some of this stuff and made a

little film out of it there's weird

stuff that shows up in these feeds like

one of the recurrent themes is this

clock

no idea why but guys who look at these

feeds like apparently it shows up from

time to time

but i think this kind of thing is

indicative of a larger thing that is

happening within the world of images and

within the visible world itself and i

think that images are perhaps

fundamentally changing

right now

traditionally when we think about images

the way the images have functioned

historically as

they function as representations so an

image it represents something you know

in the world but more and more i think

if if we haven't reached that point yet

then we're quickly approaching the point

where

the vast majority of images and

photographs made in the world will be

made by machines for other machines and

humans will never see them although

those images will do an extraordinary

amer an extraordinary amount of work in

actively sculpting

the world and so we're moving away

from this uh regime of images just being

representational and moving towards a

kind of operational regime of images and

that's something that i'm trying to

think about quite a lot

um i'll leave you with a final note

which um

a lot of times uh the first question

that everybody's going to ask me i'm

going to preempt that by saying uh

people ask me do i get hassled by law

enforcement intelligence agencies and

that sort of thing i don't like talking

about that and i don't like talking

about that because i fundamentally think

that these are civic institutions right

um that

um

i don't think that these guys who make

patches who say let them fear

let them hate as long as they fear i

don't think they get to win

right and i don't think that we should

have an attitude towards these agencies

i don't think we should live in fear of

them

and and so this is why i speak about

these projects in the way that i do i'm

making fun of them i you know i laugh

about them because i don't think that uh

that we're going to do very well for

ourselves if we pursue participate in

the culture of fear that we have towards

our own civic institutions which is

ultimately what these things are

and i'll take any questions if anybody's

got something

hi hi there right if you've got

questions can you line up between the

mic behind the microphones in the aisles

um

do we have any questions from the

internet

yes we do go ahead while we line them up

here

we'll take a question from the internet

okay there are two questions from the

internet first one is do you know

anything about underground bases

do i know anything about underground

bases sure there's underground bases um

there

yeah there's underground bases of places

like the blue cube but places like nsa

sure um but uh if you're talking about

you know underground bases that are deep

in the desert in the bottom of a

mountain there's places like norad of

course but um

but i don't think that there's big

underground bases that have no footprint

that we don't know about

again uh the logistics are just insane

to

you know think about

trevor we're gonna have to call it

that's friends

um unfortunately everything's starting

to get a bit full and we are over time

so uh if you've got any questions

questions for trevor um trevor will be

down in the

lounge

at the bar

you can stalk trevor in the bar surveil

him
