• Second quarter 2023 earnings decreased compared to second quarter 2022 primarily due to
lower upstream realizations and lower margins on refined product sales.

$65.4 billion in the year-ago period primarily due to lower commodity prices.

primarily due to record Permian Basin production of 772,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day.
• Capex in the second quarter of 2023 was up 18 percent from a year ago primarily due to
higher investment in the United States.
